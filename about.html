            <h1>About Me</h1>
             <p>When i was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band he said, son, 
                when you grow up, would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned? he said, will you defeat them, your demons and all the non-believers, the plans that they have made? because one day, ill leave you a phantom to lead you in the summer to join the black parade when i was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band he said, son, when you grow up.
                Would you be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned? 
                sometimes, i get the feeling shes watching over me and other times, i feel like i should 
                go and through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets and when youre gone, we want you all 
                to know well carry on, well carry on and though youre dead and gone, believe me your memory will carry on, well carry on and in 
                my heart, i cant contain it the anthem wont explain it a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams your misery.
            </p>
